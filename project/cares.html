          Here we talk about the main care to take into account for kittens so
          they can grow up happy and without difficulties. First you must
          identify if the cat is pregnant, a growth in the volume of the cat's
          body is notable. When it is first time it can be a little doubtful if
          it is really pregnant, however there is a sign to which we must be
          very aware and prepared in the behavior of the cat, since it will
          begin to look for hiding places or get into the clothes looking for a
          new place where accommodate if your site is not the most comfortable.
          It is important that as soon as we notice this behavior we provide her
          with a comfortable place and out of danger, and even more important is
          that the cat DOES NOT GET STRESSED, this is the main problem that we
          must take care of, once the cat gives birth to her pups, we must find
          out if the kittens are in the place that was provided or even if he
          has had them in another hiding place, it is important to give him a
          place where the cat is not disturbed It is important that we locate
          where their kittens are and not touch them nor stare at the kittens no
          matter how adorable they are, we just have to locate the site and be
          careful that the cat goes to stay her kittens. touching the cats or
          interrupting the cat could only stress her a lot to the point of
          abandoning the kittens which we don't want, but if we want the mother
          to take care of them, I have had experiences in which the cat has
          given birth in places dangerous, in this case if we should move the
          cats but not do it directly with our hands, we could help ourselves
          with a cloth that does not have any smell of any chemical
