          I am Timoteo Tapia from Mexico(Mexico City), I have two children who
          likes to be naughty, I am excited to take this course and I have to
          admit I have a little bit of fear due to English is not my first
          language, listening videos and cummunicate with others is overwhelming
          for me. I hope to get some friends here and enjoy being sociable.
